It's noteworthy that BERT seems to perform better on uncleaned text while RoBERTa performs better on cleaned text, although the effect is pretty minimal. All four of the BERT and RoBERTa models perform at or above 80% consistently.\n","\n","It's possible that BERT performs better on uncleaned data because it is better able to capture patterns from metadata such as punctuation, hashtags, and mentions that were removed during data cleaning. The predictive power of metadata is further evident in the FNN metadata model, which includes features such as tweet word count, number of hashtags, number of mentions, and number of spelling errors, but does not include the text of the tweets itself. Despite this limitation, the FNN model achieves an accuracy of up to 70% on some epochs, which is not as high as the BERT and RoBERTa models' accuracies of around 85%, but still notable considering it only relies on metadata.\n","\n","RoBERTa performs slighlty better on cleaned versus uncleaned text. Based on my research, RoBERTa, which stands for \"Robustly Optimized BERT,\" is specifically designed to improve the pre-training process of BERT by using additional data and training techniques. However, it's possible that this increased robustness actually makes RoBERTa more sensitive to noise in the data, resulting in decreased performance compared to the cleaned data. I would be interested to explore more of what makes BERT and RoBERTa perform different on cleaned and uncleaned text!"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.12"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
